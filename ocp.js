/**
 * What is the Open-Closed Principle?
The open-closed principle can be confusing because it's a two-direction principle. According to Bertrand Meyer's definition on Wikipedia, the open-closed principle (OCP) states that software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

This definition can be confusing, but an example and further clarification will help you understand.

There are two primary attributes in the OCP:

It is open for extension â€” This means you can extend what the module can do.
It is closed for modification â€” This means you cannot change the source code, even though you can extend the behavior of a module or entity.
OCP means that a class, module, function, and other entities can extend their behavior without modifying their source code. In other words, an entity should be extendable without modifying the entity itself. How?

For example, suppose you have an array of iceCreamFlavours, which contains a list of possible flavors. In the makeIceCream class, a make() method will check if a particular flavor exists and logs a message.

 */

const iceCreamFlavors = ['chocolate', 'vanilla'];

class makeIceCream {
    constructor(flavor) {
        this.flavor = flavor;
    }

    make() {
        if (iceCreamFlavors.indexOf(this.flavor) > -1) {
            console.log('Great success. You now have ice cream.');
        } else {
            console.log('Epic fail. No ice cream for you.');
        }
    }
}
/**
 * The code above fails the OCP principle. Why? Well, because the code above is not open to an extension, meaning for you to add new flavors, you would need to directly edit the iceCreamFlavors array. This means that the code is no longer closed to modification. Haha (that's a lot).

To fix this, you would need an extra class or entity to handle addition, so you no longer need to modify the code directly to make any extension.
 */

class addIceCream {
    constructor(flavor) {
        this.flavor = flavor;
    }
    add() {
        iceCreamFlavors.push(this.flavor);
    }
}
/**
 * Here, we've added a new class â€” addIceCream â€“ to handle addition to the iceCreamFlavors array using the add() method. This means your code is closed to modification but open to an extension because you can add new flavors without directly affecting the array. 
 */
let addStrawberryFlavor = new addIceCream('strawberry');
addStrawberryFlavor.add();
makeStrawberryIceCream.make();
// Also, notice that SRP is in place because you created a new class. ðŸ˜Š
